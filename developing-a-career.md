Developing Your Career
======================

Titles
------

Titles are defined within a particular role, e.g. software developer. and progress from Associate to Fellow
across all roles. There are five levels for each role:

 * Associate
 * Specialist
 * Senior
 * Principal
 * Fellow

Titles are primarily used to distinguish for compensation. In the normal course of days, we don't display or worry
about titles. And we don't brandish titles like badges of honor in our email signatures or on our desks. 


Compensation
------------

We pay at the top 5% of Twin Cities salary levels for our industry, regardless of where an employee lives. We don't pay
bonuses or stock as we believe that a big salary is the most efficient form of compensation. Everyone in the same role
at the same level is paid the same salary. That salary is visible to all employees.


Reviews
-------

We perform bi-yearly reviews in April and October. Everyone who has been with the company at least 90 days gets a 
review. During this review period, someone may be promoted or may elect 
to change roles. In this case, if someone is promoted or elect to change their role, then their salary will be
adjusted in the following month (May and November, respectively).
