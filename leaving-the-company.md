Leaving the Company
===================

We'd love for everyone to want to stay with Aerial Giant until they retire. But, the reality is that in the modern 
workforce, many people are looking to leave their current companies within a year. We think we can do better, and 
to do so, we start by recognizing that not everyone will stay with us their entire career.

Worthy Efforts
--------------
When employees start, they will meet with the head of the team they're joining to establish a four-year engagement. 
This engagement outlines a significant project or effort that mutually benefits the employee and the team. 
This could be a new architectural approach, a new product, or even starting a new business. 
The important part is that both parties understand and agree that theyâ€™ve entered into a voluntary 
relationship of mutual benefit. Proress on this engagement is included as part of the semi-annual review.

This formalization of the engagement provides for a more graceful exit for those who have finished their engagement,
who are no longer engaged with the organization, or who aren't performing to expectations.

Leaving
-------
Most employees don't tell their manager that they are looking for their next job for fear of retribution: 
that they'll be demoted, that they won't get further assignments, or that they will be considered outcast.

We want to make it as easy as possible for people to leave - we never want someone to feel trapped in their job.
And more so, we would prefer to be a partner in these situations in order to help everyone plan for the possible
departure. For all departing employees - voluntary or otherwise, we offer two weeks of salary for every year 
they've worked for the company, plus placement services to help them find their next job.

Ideally, the departing employee will be an ambassador for Aerial Giant and become an extension of our network.
To help retain this connection, we've formed an Aerial Giant Alumni group and invite the alumni back annually 
to reconnect.
