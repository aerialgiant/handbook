Here are a few of the elements of this handbook that we drew inspiration from in creating ours:
* We're a team, not a family - in egalitarian structures, it's easy to misconstrue these two.
* The Keeper Test - Which of my people, if they told me they were leaving for a similar job at a peer company,  
would I fight hard to keep at Netflix? This litmus test should be shared by all peers, of their peers.
* Hours - we don't measure people by how many ours they work or how much they are in the office.
* Freedom - scale up the business by _increasing_ employee freedom.
* Context vs Control - we believe teams should provide context to work, strategy, and vision, but not control.
* Market Comp Review - we will benchmark compensation every six months for all roles, not just at hire.
* No Bonuses - big salary is the most efficient form of comp; employees can decide how much stock they want vs. cash.
* No Vesting or Deferred Comp - employees are free to leave at anytime, without penalty; employees stay because
they are passionate about their work, and well paid, not because of a deferred compensation system.
* No Ranking - we don't want employees to feel competitive with each other; we want employees to help each other out;
we want all of our employees to be top 10% relative to the global pool of employees.

And here are a few things from this handbook that we choose not to include:
* No Vacation Policy - we believe these can work against individuals by not giving them clear guidance that vacations
are a healthy part of work-life balance. So, we will provide Vacation Guidelines which are clear, but not prescriptive.
* Promotions - "we don't want to limit promotions just because the job isn't big enough"; we'll sidestep this by 
creating a two-layer organization similar to Basecamp - Executive and Heads of teams.
* Development - "we develop people by giving them the opportunity to develop themselves"; we believe a more effective
approach is to develop a mentoring system available to all employees.
