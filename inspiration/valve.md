Valve

Here are a few of the elements of this handbook that we drew inspiration from in creating ours:
* Your First Day - seems obvious, but we should have a first day section that helps people from day one.
* Valve Facts That Matter - Valve is self-funded. This is a delimma that most startups have.
* Welcome to Flatland - a flat structure has downsides, but is likely close to what we want with Aerial Giant.

And here are a few things from this handbook that we choose not to include:
* Stack-ranking - these ways of measuring performance often turn into individual competition instead of team success.
* Unstructured work - we prefer self-organizing teams; the difference is that individuals agree to the team's terms.
