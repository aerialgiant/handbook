Aerial Giant Employee Handbook
==============================

At Aerial Giant, we're starting with an employee handbook from the beginning for two reasons: 
* we want to instill transparency in what we do, right from the beginning
* we want this to be a living, breathing document that helps us do the right things as we grow

Aerial Giant is an anagram of egalitarian. For us, this represents equality for all of our employees.
And by equality, we mean that all employees have an equal voice in important actions affecting
the organization. This doesn't mean that all roles and contributions are equal. We'll explore this topic in more detail.
