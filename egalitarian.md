Egalitarian
===========

Aerial Giant is an anagram of egalitarian. For us, this represents equality for all of our employees.
And by equality, we mean that all employees have an equal voice in important actions affecting
the organization.

This doesn't mean that all roles and contributions are equal. We believe that people's contributions change
as they master their domain. Additionally, we recognize that the job market rewards roles differently based on a
variety of factors - and that this job market affects the ability for us to attract and retain top talent.
Consequently, compensation for various roles at different levels is based on market benchmarks.
