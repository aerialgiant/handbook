Egalitarian
===========

Aerial Giant is an anagram of egalitarian. For us, this represents equality for all of our employees.
And by equality, we mean that all employees have an equal voice in important actions affecting
the organization. For example, whether or not the CEO continues in their role is up to 

This doesn't mean that all roles and contributions are equal. We believe that people's contributions change
as they master their domain. Additionally, we recognize that the job market rewards roles differently based on a
variety of factors - and that this job market affects the ability for us to attract and retain top talent.
Consequently, compensation for various roles at different levels is based on market benchmarks.

Chief Executive Officer
-----------------------

In most organizations, too much power is concentrated into a single role - the role at the top of the org structure.
But, having a CEO does have advantages in offering clarity of strategy and efficiency of execution in a
world that is constantly changing and creating new challenges.

To limit this power, Aerial Giant institutes two practices:
* no people report directly to the CEO
* the CEO agrees to a four-year engagement (the same as all employees), and every two years, must have agreement 
of 60% of employees to continue in their role.

At any point in time, a named, visible to all employees successor is identified in case of sudden departure of the CEO.


Chief People Officer
--------------------

As a balance, and for legal considerations, all employees report to the CPO with the exception of the CEO.

With the intent to limit the power of the CPO, Aerial Giant institutes two practices:
* in the rare case that someone must be fire or layed off from the organization, 
both the CEO and CPO must agree on the action(s).
* the CPO agrees to a four-year engagement (the same as all employees), and every two years, must have agreement
of 60% of employees to continue in their role.
